# My Remedy 


- my remedy is a platform where you can share and build your menstrual remedy. 

- people can create a user, login, and post blogs/recipes/advice to the guide 



## Commands

`npm run dev` run dev server

`npm run start` run in production more



## Limitations 

- profile page doesn't show the info of the logged in user, instead it shows all of the users 

- Canâ€™t actually edit the info posted to the database


## Challenges

- "add to the guide" route fetches data from the database that the user added and displays it 

- couldn't add to the auth models schema and store other user info aside from username and password 

## Improvements
- dynamically change nav bar from "login" to "profile" and vice versa based on user status

-  dynamically add in widgets from IG and Twitter allowing users to  embed widgets from IG and Twitter to add to the guide

- Dynamically add edit & delete to the posts the logged in user posted

- have  like feature where users can "like" or "add" a guide post to their personal remedy which would be shown in the profile page
